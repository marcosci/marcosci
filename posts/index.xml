      <description>Undirected Graphs Some problems  Path Shortest path Cycle Ehler tour: A cycle that uses each edge excatly once. Hamilton tour: A cycle that uses each vertex exactly once  classical NP-complete problem.  Connectivity MST: Biconnectivity: A vertex whose removal disconnects the graph Planarity Graph isomorphism: Are two graphs identical?  No one knows so far. A lonstanding open problem   Representations Real-world graphs tend to be sparse (huge number of vertices, small average vertex degree).</description>
